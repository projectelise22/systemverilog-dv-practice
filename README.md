# SystemVerilog Design Verification Practice

This repository contains hands-on **Design Verification (DV)** practice projects created to strengthen and demonstrate skills in **SystemVerilog-based verification**.

The focus is on building **clean, modular, and industry-style testbenches**, starting from simple designs and gradually introducing more advanced verification concepts.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Practice core **Design Verification fundamentals**
- Build confidence in **SystemVerilog testbench architecture**
- Apply verification concepts

---

## 🧪 What This Repository Covers

Depending on the folder/project, examples may include:

- Directed and constrained-random testing
- Transaction-based testbenches
- Interfaces, mailboxes, and OOP concepts
- Assertions (SVA)
- Functional coverage
- Scoreboards and checkers
- FIFO and basic RTL verification
- Gradual transition toward **UVM**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SystemVerilog**
- RTL simulation (tool-agnostic)
- Concepts aligned with UVM (without overcomplicating early examples)
